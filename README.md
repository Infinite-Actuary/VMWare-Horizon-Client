## What is VDI?

> Virtual Desktop Infrastructure, or VDI, refers to the process of running a user desktop inside a virtual machine that lives on a server in the datacenter. Itâ€™s a powerful form of desktop virtualization because it enables fully personalized desktops for each user with all the security and simplicity of centralized management.
